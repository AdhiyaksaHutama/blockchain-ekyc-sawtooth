## 1. Introduction
Financial and capital markets use the KYC (Know Your Customer) system to identify "bad" customers and minimise money laundering, tax evasion and terrorism financing. Efforts to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism are costing the financial sector billions of dollars. Banks are also exposed to huge penalties for failure to follow KYC guidelines. Costs aside, KYC can delay transactions and lead to duplication of effort between banks.

Blockchain-eKYC (Hyperledger Sawtooth) is a permissioned Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain for sharing corporate KYC records. The records are stored in the blockchain in an encrypted form and can only be viewed by entities that have been "whitelisted" by the issuer entity. This ensures data privacy and confidentiality while at the same time ensuring that records are shared only between entities that trust each other.

**Blockchain-eKYC (Hyperledger Sawtooth) is maintained by Rahul Tiwari, Blockchain Developer, Primechain Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**

## 2. Uploading records

![Uploading records](http://www.primechaintech.com/img/sawtooth/upload2.png)

Records can be uploaded in any format (doc, pdf, jpg etc.) upto a maximum of 10 MB per record. These records are automatically encrypted using AES symmetric encryption algorithm and the decryption keys are automatically stored in the exclusive web application of the of the uploading entity. 

***When a new record is uploaded to the blockchain, the following information must be provided:***

1. ***Corporate Identity Number (CIN)*** of the entity to which this document relates - this information is stored in the blockchain in plain text / un-encrypted form and cannot be changed.

2. ***Document category*** - this information is stored in the blockchain in plain text / un-encrypted form and cannot be changed.

3. ***Document type*** - this information is stored in the blockchain in plain text / un-encrypted form and cannot be changed.

4. ***A brief description of the document*** - This information is stored in the blockchain in plain text / un-encrypted form and cannot be changed.

5. ***The document*** - this document can be in pdf, word, excel, image or other formats and is stored in the blockchain in AES encrypted form and cannot be changed. The decryption key is stored in the relevant bank's dedicated database and does NOT go into the blockchain. 

***When the above information is provided, this is what happens:***
1. Hash of the uploaded file is calculated.
2. The file is digitally signed using the private key of the uploader bank.
3. File Data is encrypted using AES symmetric encryption.
4. The encrypted file is converted into hexadecimal.
5. The non-encrypted data is converted into hexadecimal.
6. Hexadecimal content is uploaded to the blockchain.

## 3. Nuts and bolts

This section uses the following terminoloy: 
* [Transaction Processor](https://intelledger.github.io/architecture/transactions_and_batches.html) - this is the business logic / smart contracts layer.
* [Validator Process](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/architecture/global_state.html) - this is the Global State Store layer. 
* Client Application (User)	- this implies a user on solution; the userâ€™s public key executes the transactions.

### 3.1	Transaction Processor and State:

The Transaction Processor of the eKYC application is written in Java. It contains all the business logic of the application. Hyperledger Sawtooth stores data within a Merkle Tree. Data is stored in leaf nodes, and each node is accessed using an addressing scheme that is composed of 35 bytes, represented as 70 hex characters. 

Using the Corporate Identity Number or CIN, provided by user while uploading, a 70 characters (35 bytes) address is created for uploading a record to the blockchain. To understand the Address creation and Namespace design process [see this](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/1.0/app_developers_guide/address_and_namespace.html)

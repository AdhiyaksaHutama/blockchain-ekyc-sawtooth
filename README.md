# Blockchain-eKYC (Hyperledger Sawtooth)
### Open source eKYC blockchain built on Hyperledger Sawtooth

## Introduction
Financial and capital markets use the KYC (Know Your Customer) system to identify "bad" customers and minimise money laundering, tax evasion and terrorism financing. Efforts to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism are costing the financial sector billions of dollars. Banks are also exposed to huge penalties for failure to follow KYC guidelines. Costs aside, KYC can delay transactions and lead to duplication of effort between banks.

Blockchain-eKYC (Hyperledger Sawtooth) is a permissioned Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain for sharing corporate KYC records amongst banks and other financial institutions. 

The records are stored in the blockchain in an encrypted form and can only be viewed by entities that have been "whitelisted" by the issuer entity. This ensures data privacy and confidentiality while at the same time ensuring that records are shared only between entities that trust each other.

Blockchain-eKYC (Hyperledger Sawtooth) is maintained by Rahul Tiwari, Blockchain Developer, [Primechain Technologies Pvt. Ltd.](http://www.primechaintech.com/)
